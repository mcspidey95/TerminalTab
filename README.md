## Description

Are you tired of staring at Google's boring, plain new tab page? 😴 Do you wish your new tab could be as cool and productive as you are? Well, you're in luck! Welcome to **TerminalTab** - the only new tab page that understands your inner awesomeness. 😎

Why settle for Google's vanilla new tab when you can have a homepage that:
- **Looks fantastic** (like a homepage should).
- **Has all the features you need** (unlike Google's "here's a search bar, you're welcome").
- **Makes you feel like a tech wizard** (move over, Tony Stark).

Say goodbye to boring old Google tab and hello to a new tab experience that’s fun, functional, and fabulously you!
