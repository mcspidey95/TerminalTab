## Description

Are you tired of staring at Google's boring, plain new tab page? 😴 Do you wish your new tab could be as cool and productive as you are? Well, you're in luck! Welcome to **TerminalTab** - the only new tab page that understands your inner awesomeness. 😎

Why settle for Google's vanilla new tab when you can have a homepage that:
- **Looks fantastic** (like a homepage should).
- **Has all the features you need** (unlike Google's "here's a search bar, you're welcome").
- **Makes you feel like a tech wizard** (move over, Tony Stark).

Say goodbye to boring old google tab and hello to a new tab experience that’s fun, functional, and fabulously you!

## Features

- 🎨 **Customizable Themes**: Because one size does not fit all.
- 💻 **Terminal-like Design**: To remind you of those nostalgic coding sessions you definitely dont hate.
- 🔎 **Quick Search Options**: Choose your preferred search engine and go!
- 🌟 **Favorite Links**: Access your go-to websites in a jiffy.
- 😍 **Fidgety Backgrounds**: A Background designed to pass time... especially if you're bored :)

## Instructions (One Time Setup)

### Windows

0.  **PREREQUISITES**:
    - Install Python from the Microsoft Store: [Python 3.12](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NCVDN91XZQP?ocid=pdpshare). Don't come and complain that it doesnt work later.. Install it now 🧑‍💻

1. **Install the Extension**:
    - Pick any one Setup.. based on your mood 🥰

2. **Install the Extension**:
    - Open your browser and install this web extension: [New Tab Redirect](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna). (Because your browser is useless 🍇)
    - If you have firefox, use this: [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/). (This browser is even more useless 💅)

3. **Set the New Tab URL**:
    - Paste this URL in the extension’s menu. This is where the magic happens. 🌟
       ```
       http://localhost:8000/index.html
       ```

4. **Restart Your Laptop**:
    - Give your laptop a quick restart and voilà! Your terminal-themed homepage awaits. 🚀
    - Press `Ctrl + f5` after updates to clear cache. (Ctrl + fn + f5 if that doesnt work) 💅

And there you have it! Your new tab page is ready to dazzle and delight. If any step seems tricky, don’t worry - we’ll have screenshots to guide you through! 📷

Enjoy your new, super cool custom homepage! 🌐
